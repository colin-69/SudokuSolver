# SudokuSolver

This is a simple python program that can solve any valid sudoku board. The program trys to input a number(1-9) until it finds a valid one.
If and/or when there isn't a valid number to be put into a square the program backtracks to the previous cell and repeats until it finds another valid number.
This process continues until the board is solved.
